Title

Remodeling of the postsynaptic proteome in male mice and marmosets during synapse development

Abstract

Postsynaptic proteins play crucial roles in synaptic function and plasticity. During brain development, alterations in synaptic number, shape, and stability occur, known as synapse maturation. However, the postsynaptic protein composition changes during development are not fully understood. Here, we show the trajectory of the postsynaptic proteome in developing male mice and common marmosets. Proteomic analysis of mice at 2, 3, 6, and 12 weeks of age shows that proteins involved in synaptogenesis are differentially expressed during this period. Analysis of published transcriptome datasets shows that the changes in postsynaptic protein composition in the mouse brain after 2 weeks of age correlate with gene expression changes. Proteomic analysis of marmosets at 0, 2, 3, 6, and 24 months of age show that the changes in the marmoset brain can be categorized into two parts: the first 2 months and after that. The changes observed in the first 2 months are similar to those in the mouse brain between 2 and 12 weeks of age. The changes observed in marmoset after 2 months old include differential expression of synaptogenesis-related molecules, which hardly overlap with that in mice. Our results provide a comprehensive proteomic resource that underlies developmental synapse maturation in rodents and primates.
